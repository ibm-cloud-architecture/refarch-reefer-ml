Most of machine learning and analytics are done on data at rest and data warehouse. In this repository we are presenting an approach to use both data at rest and in motion within kafka. Note This project is part of the reference implementation solution to demonstrate the IBM event driven reference architecture and represents one use case for the IBM Data, AI and Analytics reference architecture but it also presents how to combine different IBM cloud paks to build the solution: Cloud pak for data, Cloud pak for automation, Cloud pak for integration and Cloud pak for application. The implementation is using two different approaches: one using open sources mostly from Apache projects one using IBM Cloud Pak products As we will detail in next section , there are five components in this solution that make the end to end anomaly detection solution: a Reefer simulator (we do not have such Reefer containers in our stock yet), a container microservice to manage reefer container as entity, an analytics scoring agent combined with a deployed model as a service and a business process. The open source version integrate the model and the agent, so components 4 and 5 are integrated into the same process. Problem statements The Reefer container is an IoT device, which emits container telemetries every 3 minutes via the MQTT protocol. We want to detect sensor anomaly and trigger a field engineer dispatch job to perform maintenance when the Reefer reaches an harbor. The Reefer container carries fresh product over seas. The telemetries are kept in the event backbone (kafka) for 20 days, an average vessel travel duration. And the telemetries are also persisted for longer time period in a document database (Cassandra or Mongo) or an object storage like Ceph . Going into this content you will learn the following: how to apply anomaly detection on telemetry data using Waston Studio or Jupiter notebook and python library how to deploy the model as agent or web service using Watson ML or Kubeflow how to integrate kafka events into Pandas dataset for build test and training sets. how to develop microservice in python for scoring telemetry using Appsody Some sensors may act badly. For example the co2 sensor telemetry plotted over time shows some sporadic behavior: The goal is to identify in real time such behavior. When anomaly is detected, a new event is posted to the containers Kafka topic so the Reefer container manager microservice can apply the expected business logic. A Cloud Pak Approach To develop the solution we can use IBM Cloud Pak products as presented in the diagram below using a three layer architecture with Openshift for the deployment infrastructure. We recommend to follow the following tutorial for understanding how the solution was built. An open source based solution We also look at an open source version of this solution using an approach close to opendatahub.io proposed architecture, as illustrated in the following diagram: We are simplifying the Data ingestion layer, where normally the Reefer containers are sending telemetry via the MQTT protocol, so the data ingestion may leverage a product like Apache Nifi to transform the telemetry messages to kafka events. Apache Kafka is used as the event backbone and event sourcing so microservices, deployed on Openshift, can consume and publish messages. For persistence reason, we may leverage big data type of storage like Apache Cassandra or mongodb to persist the container's telemetries over a longer time period. This datasource is used by the Data Scientists to do its data preparation and build training and test sets and select the best model. We also illustrate how to connect to Kafka topic as data source, from a Jupyter notebook to also use data from Kafka to build training set and test set. Data scientists can run Jupyter lab on OpenShift and build a model to be deployed as python microservice, consumer of Reefer telemetry events. If you want to read more on how to build and run the solution with open source stack, see this note . MVP component view For a minimum viable demonstration the runtime components looks like in the figure below: A web app, deployed on Openshift, is running a simulator to simulate the generation of Reefer container telemetries while the container is at sea or during end to end transportation. The app exposes a simple POST operation with a control object to control the simulation. Here is an example of such control.json object { 'containerID': 'C02', 'simulation': 'co2sensor', 'nb_of_records': 1000, \"product_id\" : \"P02\" } The simulation can be done on o2sensor, co2sensor or power. A curl script does the HTTP POST request of this json object. See this paragraph. The telemetry events are sent to the reeferTelemetries topic in Kafka. They are defined as Avro schema. The predictive scoring is a consumer of such events, read one event at a time and call the model internally, then sends a new event when maintenance is required. See the note for details. The maintenance requirement is an event in the containers topic. The 6 th component of the solution, is the container microservice which was defined in the EDA reference implementation. The maintenance engineer intervention process is modeled in BPM, deploy on public cloud and the process application is exposed as API. The container identifier and the telemetry record is sent as input to the process. Project approach The solution covers different development areas and practices: event driven microservice, business process, data ops and machine learning model development. The software life cycle integrate the three main tracks of DevOps, DataOps and MLOps as presented in this methodology article . DevOps As all the services developed in this solution are event-driven we do not need to rephrase how we used event storming and applied the different patterns for each microservices. You can read the following articles to learn more: Event storming workshop From analysis to microservice using domain driven design Apply DDD to order microservice Apply DDD to the container management microservice For the adoption of Appsody and CI/CD based on tektron, we present how we use Cloud Pak for application in the development of the scoring microservice in this note .

The following diagram below, illustrates the features or components used in each cloud paks to support the implementation. The grey components are part of the solution implementation. As part of Cloud pak for Application , we are using Appsody to generate the code and the development build, test, deploy for the Reefer simulator done in Python / Flask, and for the scoring app that is a Java Microprofile 3.0 running on Liberty server. The microprofile app is also generated using Appsody and build and deploy. As part of the CI/CD tooling, we use public github (This repository !), with Github action and Tekton for the pipeline deployment. Cloud Pak for Application is deployed on Openshift 4.2 Cloud Pak for Integration is used to deploy IBM Event Streams, the IBM event backbone based on Apache Kafka. We wrote a lot of content and best practices around Kafka in the Event Driven Architecture (EDA) repository. In the EDA reference implementation solution we present other CP4I assets.

We train the model with the help of historical data to predict whether maintenance is required for the reefer container at a certain point in time. You will learn how to simulate date for reefer, develop the predictive maintenance model, and integrate the model into an application. Introduction A reefer container is a refrigerated shipping container used to store or transport frozen or cold goods perishable items or goods that require temperature control. Reefers make an excellent, portable solution for short or long term storage and can be used to ship or truck goods over long distances as they can be plugged into the power station on ships or have it clipped on generators attached. Perishable products must be kept at a controlled temperature, from point of origin to delivery to retailer or pharmacy. The logistics industry refers to this as the \u201ccold chain\u201d and it encompasses both \u201creefers\u201d (refrigerated containers) as well as warehouses, distribution centers and the final storage or holding areas. Throughout this chain the risk of failure is ever-present, meaning there is always a possibility of cargo exceeding permissible or safe temperature levels, even if only briefly. For example, a truck might be stopped without power in desert heat, allowing temperatures in the reefer to rise. Then power is restored and the temperature in the container comes back down, but the product is damaged. When cargo with such as any of those items listed above are exposed to temperatures outside of prescribed limits it can be damaged. In some cases this is evident, such as with bananas, but in other situations, like the transport of vaccines, it may not be apparent that damage has occurred and the vaccine becomes ineffective. For some products, going over temperature, even only briefly, can reduce shelf life dramatically, incurring substantial costs when it cannot be sold. Organizations contracting to ship perishable products often specify the permissible temperature range. However, even if it is possible to show that product was exposed to conditions outside of those contracted, proving where it happened, and thus responsibility, can be much harder. Predictive maintenance problem statement If you want a good understanding of the problem space for predictive maintenance read, Yana Ageeva's article in toward data science . The success of predictive maintenance models depend on three main components: having the right data framing the problem appropriately evaluating the predictions properly From a methodology point of view the Data Scientist needs to address the following questions: What type of failure to consider and which one to predict? What kind of failure is happening? slow degradation or instantaneous failure? What could be the relation between a product characteristics and the failure? What kind of measure exist to assess the given characteristic? Which measurements correspond to good functioning and which ones correspond to failure? How often metrics are reported? What question the model should answer? What kind of output should the model give? How long in advance should the model be able to indicate that a failure will occur? What are the business impact to do not predict the failure? and predicting false negative failure? What is the expected accuracy? Reefer problem types There are multiple different potential issues that could happen to a refrigerator container. We are choosing to model the \"Sensor Malfunctions\" issue: Sensors in the refrigeration unit need to be calibrated and be continuously operational. An example of failure may come from the air sensor making inaccurate readings of temperatures, which leads to sploiled content. A potential reason may come from a faulty calibration, which can go unnoticed for a good time period. It may be difficult to know if there is an issue or not. The other common potential issues are: Fluid leaks, like engine oil, coolant liquid. The preassure sensors added to the circuit may help identify preassure lost over time. Faulty belts and hoses. Faulty calibration: A non-calibrated reefer can cool at a slower or faster rate than desired. Damaged Air Chute. Condenser Issues like broken or damaged coils, clamps or bolts missing, and leaks. Door Seals damaged. Blocked air passage: to keep the temperature homogenous inside the reefer. So the question we want to answer is: does the Reefer keep accurate temperature overtime between what is set versus what is measured? Modeling techniques The model uses the generated data from above scenarios: When the container's door is open for a longer time - this gives a false positive that maintainence is required. When sensors are malfunctioning, it records arbitrary readings. When the readings are normal. We have currently trained our model on 3000 datapoints from the three scenarios above. There are different modeling approach to tackle predictive maintenance: regression model classification to predict failure for a given time period classify anomalous behavior: classes are not known in advance. Normal operation is known. compute probability of failure over time Code execution The simulator continuosly generates container metrics, publishes it to Kafka and run the predictMaintainence.ipynb to predict if maintainence is sought at this point in time. Model description We are using Machine Learning supervised learning here. There are two types of supervised learning - 1) Classification: Predict a categorical response, 2) Regression: Predict a continuous response Linear regression Pros: 1) Fast 2) No tuning required 3) Highly interpretable 4) Well-understood Cons: 1) Unlikely to produce the best predictive accuracy 2) Presumes a linear relationship between the features and response 3) If the relationship is highly non-linear as with many scenarios, linear relationship will not effectively model the relationship and its prediction would not be accurate Naive Bayes classification Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier inspired by the Bayes theorem under a simple assumption which is the attributes are conditionally independent. The classification is conducted by deriving the maximum posterior which is the maximal P(Ci|X) with the above assumption applying to Bayes theorem. This assumption greatly reduces the computational cost by only counting the class distribution. Even though the assumption is not valid in most cases since the attributes are dependent, surprisingly Naive Bayes has able to perform impressively. Naive Bayes is a very simple algorithm to implement and good results have obtained in most cases. It can be easily scalable to larger datasets since it takes linear time, rather than by expensive iterative approximation as used for many other types of classifiers. Naive Bayes can suffer from a problem called the zero probability problem. When the conditional probability is zero for a particular attribute, it fails to give a valid prediction. This needs to be fixed explicitly using a Laplacian estimator. Model evaluation We are using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for evaluating the model performance. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is the square root of the mean of the squared errors. Classification does better here as the scenarion is more of a classification problem.

In the industry, when developing new manufactured product, the engineers do not have a lot of data so they also use a mix of real sensors with simulators to create fake but realistic data to develop and test their models. The historical data need to represent failure, and represent the characteristics of a Reefer container. We have defined some sensors to get interesting correlated or independant features. As of now our telemetry event structure can be seen in this avro schema . For the machine learning environment we can use csv file or mongodb database or kafka topic as data source. The data generation environment looks like in the figure below: Figure 1: Data collection Simulation The simulator can run as a standalone tool (1) to create training and test data to be saved in a remote mongodb database or can be used to save to csv file. when it runs to simulate reefer container telemetry generation (2), it creates events to Kafka topic, and a stream application can save telemetry records to MongoDB too. We use mongodb as a service on IBM cloud. IBM Cloud Database Isolated python environment If not done yet, you can use our docker image to get an isolated python environment. For that do the following preparation steps: # From refarch_reefer_ml folder cd docker docker build -t ibmcase/python -f docker-python-tools.yaml . docker images | grep ibmcase # .... results should include ibmcase/python latest a89153c0e14f The dockerfile installed the needed dependencies and use pipenv. Also we preset the PYTHONPATH environment variable to /home to specify where python should find the application specifics modules. Generate data as csv file Start the python environment From the docker image created before, use the provided script as: # From refarch_reefer_ml folder ./startPythonEnv.sh Generate power off metrics When a reefer container loses power, restart and reloose it, it may become an issue. This is the goal of this simulation. The simulator accepts different arguments as specified below: usage reefer_simulator-tool --stype [ poweroff | co2sensor | o2sensor | normal ] --cid [ C01 | C02 | C03 | C04 | C05 ] --product_id [ P01 | P02 | P03 | P04 | P05 ] --records <the number of records to generate> --file <the filename to create> --append | --db The cid is for the container id. As the simulator is taking some data from internal datasource you can use only one of those values: [C01 | C02 | C03 | C04 | C05] product_id is also one of the value [ P01 | P02 | P03 | P04 | P05] , as the simulator will derive the target temperature and humidity level from its internal datasource: ('P01','Carrots',1,4,0.4), ('P02','Banana',2,6,0.6), ('P03','Salad',1,4,0.4), ('P04','Avocado',2,6,0.4), ('P05','Tomato',1,6,0.4); --db is when you want to save the telemetry into mongodb DB. In this case be sure to have set the credentials and URL in the scripts/setenv.sh script (see the scripts/setenv-tmp.sh template file) --file is to specify a csv file to write the data --append is used to append the output of this run to an existing file: It permits to accumulate different simulation in the same dataset. (Re)create a new file. It is an important step to get the column names as first row. python simulator/reefer_simulator_tool.py --stype poweroff --cid C01 --records 1000 --product_id P02 --file telemetries.csv then new records are added by appending to existing file python simulator/reefer_simulator_tool.py --cid C03 --product_id P03 --records 1000 --file telemetries.csv --stype poweroff --append The results looks like: Generating 1000 poweroff metrics Timestamp ID Temperature ( celsius ) Target_Temperature ( celsius ) Power PowerConsumption ContentType O2 CO2 Time_Door_Open Maintenance_Required Defrost_Cycle 1 .000000 2019 -06-30 T15:43 Z 101 3 .416766 4 17 .698034 6 .662044 1 11 1 8 .735273 0 6 1 .001001 2019 -06-30 T15:43 Z 101 4 .973630 4 3 .701072 8 .457314 1 13 3 5 .699655 0 6 1 .002002 2019 -06-30 T15:43 Z 101 1 .299275 4 7 .629094 From the two previous commands you should have 2001 rows (one for the header which will be used in the model creation): wc -l telemetries.csv 2001 telemetries.csv Generate Co2 sensor malfunction in same file In the same way as above the simulator can generate data for Co2 sensor malfunction using the command: python simulator/reefer_simulator_tool.py --cid C03 --product_id P02 --records 1000 --file basedata --stype co2sensor --append Generate O2 sensor malfunction in same file python simulator/reefer_simulator_tool.py --cid C03 --product_id P02 --records 1000 --file basedata --stype o2sensor --append Saving to Mongodb MongoDB is a popular document-based database that allows developers to quickly build projects without worrying about schema. Mongo components include: mongod - the core process that runs the actual database mongos - controls routing to the databases in case of sharding config servers (CSRS) - stores the metadata in a sharded environment. We propose to persist telemetry for a long time period. For example we can configure Kafka topic to persist telemetries over a period of 20 days, but have another component to continuously move events as JSON documents inside Mongodb. Using Mongodb as service on IBM Cloud Create the MongoDB service on IBM cloud using default configuration and add a service credentials to get the mongodb.composed url: (something starting as mongodb://ibm_cloud_e154ff52_ed ) username and password.

Add data from csv file Using the ToMongo.py script we can load the data from the ml/data/telemetries.csv file to mongodb.

What_to_learn In this article we shortly present the design and implementation approaches used for this application, as well as how to use appsody to jumpstart the implementation, and continously run and debug the application. We are presenting some best practice on TDD with python. Requirements: Job Stories The simulator is not in the critical path for production like component. It is here to help us develop the other components of the solution as we do not have real life Reefer container. To try something different, we are not using user stories to present what the simulator should do but we are using job stories . when I want to generate mockup telemetries data for my data scientist friend, I want to start the simulator tool from command line so I can get a csv file with data when I want to generate mockup telemetries data for my data scientist friend, I want to be able to simulate co2 sensor, o2 sensor and power sensor issue so I can get relevant data for the machine learning model to make sense when I want to generate mockup telemetries data for my data scientist friend, I want to start the simulator tool from command line using parameter so I can get save data to a remote document oriented database: mongodb on IBM cloud. when I want to demonstrate the solution, I want to call a REST api to control the generation of faulty sensor data so I can get the scoring service returning maintenance needed. The simulator needs to integrate with kafka / event stream deployed as service on the cloud or on-premise on openshift. Design approach To support remote control of the simulator while running as webapp, we define a POST operation on the /control URL: with a json control object to define the number records to simulate, the sensor to impact (co2sensor, o2sensor, power) , the container ID, (one of C01, C02, C03, C04) which carries the product referenced by product_id (one of P01, P02, P03, P04, P05): { 'containerID': 'C02', 'simulation': 'co2sensor', 'nb_of_records': 1000, \"product_id\" : \"P02\" } We have tried to support a domain driven design approach to structure the code, with domain, infrastructure and app modules. The domain module has a unique class for the simulator which main goals is to generate tuples or records for the different simulation types. It is reused for the standalone simulation tools to generate data at rest. As the simulator is also a webapp we need to package it with Flask and run it using one of the Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) implementation with Gunicorn . We recommend to follow Flask tutorial if you do not know this python library to develop web app or REST service. Flask is a simple library to implement REST based microservice and web application in python. It has other related projects to add interesting features to develop production application. The standard development includes defining routes, function to support handling the request and generating HTTP response, but also defining APIs... Read more with the explore Flask book online . Flask is mono threaded so it fits well in a simple web application for development purpose, but for production it is recommended to add a web server like Gunicorn to handle multiple concurrent requests. Code approach The application is built using Appsody as the developer experience tooling. The Appsody CLI is required locally to build and deploy the application properly. The app is done using Flask, and the code is generated using appsody init python-flask command with the Python Flask appsody stack and template. Appsody helps developer to do not worry about the details of k8s deployment and build. During a Appsody run, debug or test step (2), Appsody creates a Docker container based on the parent stack Dockerfile, and combines application code with the source code in the template. We recommend reading the Python Flask Appsody Stack git hub repo to get familiar with appsody python stack. This stack is defining the Flask application, and import the 'userapp' where the application code resides, then use blueprints to define health and metrics APIs: from flask import Flask app = Flask ( __name__ ) from userapp import * from server.routes.health import health_bp app . register_blueprint ( health_bp ) from server.routes.prometheus import metrics_bp app . register_blueprint ( metrics_bp ) This code is not updatable as it is part of the image. But we can add our business logic as part of the simulator/__init__.py code using another Flask blueprints module api/controller.py . The userapp module is defined when appsody integrates our code with the stack base image using Docker. Below is an extract of the docker file managing module installation and defining what appsody does during build, run and test: ENV APPSODY_MOUNTS=/:/project/userapp ENV APPSODY_DEPS=/project/deps WORKDIR /project RUN python -m pip install -r requirements.txt -t /project/deps ENV FLASK_APP=server/__init__.py Looking at the content of the final docker container running the application we can see this structure: /project |-- Dockerfile Pipfile Pipfile.lock constraints.txt requirements.txt deps/ server/ test/ userapp/ The basic concept of blueprints is that they record operations to execute when registered on an application. So to add the operation to support the control we add a blueprint, and then register it in the main application: __init__py . from userapp.api.controller import control_blueprint app . register_blueprint ( control_blueprint ) To define the API, we use Flasgger as an extension to Flask to extract Open API specification from the code. It comes with Swagger UI, so we can see the API documentation of the microservice at the URL /apidocs . It can also validate the data according to the schema defined. For the POST /control we define the using Swagger 2.0 the API in a separate file: api/controlapi.yml and import it at the method level to support the POSt operation. This method is defined in its blueprint as a REST resource. The code controller.py is under api folder. Below is a code extract to illustrate the use of Flask-RESTful and blueprint and the swagger annotation: from flasgger import swag_from from flask_restful import Resource , Api control_blueprint = Blueprint ( \"control\" , __name__ ) api = Api ( control_blueprint ) class SimulationController ( Resource ): @swag_from ( 'controlapi.yml' ) def post ( self ): # .. api . add_resource ( SimulationController , \"/control\" ) The Pipfile defines the dependencies for this component, and is used by pipenv during the automatic build process within appsody build . To launch the web application in development mode, using an IBM Event Streams remote use the following commands: # set environment variables - from simulator folder $ source ../scripts/setenv.sh OCP # Start appsody with the environment variables: in simulator folder $ appsody run --docker-options = \"-e KAFKA_BROKERS= $KAFKA_BROKERS -e KAFKA_APIKEY= $KAFKA_APIKEY -e KAFKA_CERT= $KAFKA_CERT -e TELEMETRY_TOPIC= $TELEMETRY_TOPIC -e CONTAINER_TOPIC= $CONTAINER_TOPIC \" The trace shows the Kafka configuration options: Kafka options are: [Container] {'bootstrap.servers': 'eventstream140-ibm-es-proxy-route-broker-0-eventstreams.apps.green.ocp.csplab.local:443', 'group.id': 'ReeferTelemetryProducers', 'security.protocol': 'SASL_SSL', 'sasl.mechanisms': 'PLAIN', 'sasl.username': 'token', 'sasl.password': 'xCByo4478xQH...EVdcbGNCtLLuItKgVDc', 'ssl.ca.location': '/project/userapp/certs/ocp/es-cert.pem'} Testing Unit test the Simulator The test coverage is not yet great.

A ConfigMap named kafka-brokers Reference Link A Secret named eventstreams-api-key Reference Link A Secret named eventstreams-cert-pem (if connecting to an on-premise version of IBM Event Streams) Reference Link Once those elements are defined it is important to configure the app so it can retrieve those information via environment variables. With Appsody the file appsody-config.yaml is supporting these configurations. See the lines 24 to 40 to get the settings to map environment variables to config maps or secrets. When using TSL connection, the TLS certificate is mounted inside the container via mounted file system. Inside the container the directory will be /certs and the volume is in fact a secret containing the pem certificate as string. volumeMounts : - mountPath : /certs name : eventstreams-cert-pem volumes : - name : eventstreams-cert-pem secret : optional : true secretName : eventstreams-cert-pem Build The Docker image can be built from this directory by using the appsody build command: Ensure you are logged in to the desired remote Docker registry through your local Docker client. The appsody build -t ibmcase/kcontainer-reefer-simulator:appsody-v1 --push command will build and push the application's Docker image to the specified remote image registry (here this is the public docker hub repository). Application deployment The application can be deployed to a remote OpenShift cluster by using the appsody deploy command (We recommend reading Appsody build and deploy product documentation ): Deploy using the docker image on public docker hub repository: # login to the openshift cluster if not done already oc login --token = rR.... --server = https://api.green.ocp.csplab.local:6443 # Deploy to the eda-sandbox project appsody deploy -t ibmcase/kcontainer-reefer-simulator:appsody-v1 --namespace eda-sandbox --no-build You can verify the deployment with the CLI oc get pods or the via the Openshift console: To make the webapp visible externally to the cluster, you need to add a route for this deployment. Login to the admin console and use Create Route button on top right of the screen, Then enter a name and select the existing service Once created, the URL of the app is visible in the route list panel: Add the host name in your local /etc/hosts or be sure the hostname is defined in DNS server. Map to the IP address of the kubernetes proxy server end point. Continuous deployment with Tekton The general approach to use Tekton to deploy the components of the solution is defined in this note . Usage Once deployed, you can access the Swagger-based REST API via the defined route and trigger the simulation controls. To determine the route, use the oc get route reefer-simulator command and go to the URL specified in the HOST/PORT field in your browser. From there, drill down into the POST /control section and click Try it out! . Enter any of the following options for the fields prepopulated in the control body: Container: C01, C02, C03, C04 Product: P01, P02, P03, P04 Simulation: poweroff, co2sensor, o2sensor, normal Number of records: A positive integer Click Execute To generate data at rest The same simulator can be run as a standalone tool to create csv files or to write to a remote mongoDB database.
